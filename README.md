# Letterboxd Rating on IMDb
This is a Userscript to show a film's Letterboxd rating on its IMDb page alongside the IMDb rating. Clicking the rating will take you to the film's Letterboxd page.
I wrote this script as the few out there in existence are either broken since IMDb's film page redesign, or make no effort to show the Letterboxd rating in a way that feels natural and native within IMDb's design.

### Installation
Most popular userscript managers such as Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey will prompt you to install simply by viewing the [.user.js file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisjp/LetterboxdOnIMDb/master/Letterboxd%20rating%20on%20IMDb.user.js) in your browser. If not, add a new script in your userscript manager and paste the contents of the file and save it.
